1. What is a network (general definition)? 
-Defined recursively as consisting of two or more nodes connected by a physical link. 
-Set of serial lines to attach dumb terminals to mainframe computers. 
-Specialized to handle one type of data
-connect to special-purpose devices
Constructed from a nesting of networks, with a physical-medium bottom level. 


2. What are key challenges in providing network connectivity?
-Definition of an address for each node that is reachable on the network (logical or physical).
-Use of addresses to forward messages toward the appropriate destination nodes.


3. What distinguishes a computer network from other types of networks?
Generality; built from general-purpose programmable hardware, not optimized for a particular application, taken over functions of single-use networks.


4. What does a network architecture do?
Identifies the available hardware and software components and shows how they can be arranged to form a complete network system.


5. What are types of networking applications? 
World Wide Web, email, social media, streaming, videoconferencing, instant messaging, file sharing.


6. What are types of network interactions?
Users, application creators, network operators/managers, network designers/builders.


7. How is complexity of multiple access addressed? How works?
-Indirect connectivity is implemented using switched network or internetwork. 


8. Describe the two ways computers can be indirectly connected.
1. Switched Network: Node connected to two or more point-to-point links use software to forward data to and from particular nodes.
-Packet-switched network transport discrete blocks of data.
-Uses store-and-forward strategy, node (switch) receives, stores, then forwards data.
-More efficient than circuit-switched networks.
2. Internetwork (internet): Set of independent networks (clouds) are interconnected.


9. What are switches and hosts? Cloud?
-Switches are nodes on the inside that implement the network.
-Hosts are nodes outside of the cloud that use the network, supporting users and running application programs.
-Cloud is one of most important icons of computer networking. Used to denote any type of network; point-to-point, multiple-access, or switched.


10. What is a router?
A router (or gateway) is a node connected to two or more networks, forwarding messages like a switch. Can be recursive, which is the fundamental innovation of the Internet. Routers’ purpose is to use routing algorithms to determine the best next hop router to send a layer 3 packet to. Therefore, they do not handle layer 3 packet creation, which is the host’s responsibility. They do, however, have a MAC address and the ability to forward layer 2 frames within a network, in addition to routing layer 3 packets to other networks.


  
  





11. What is an address?
Addresses are identifying byte strings that allow hosts to say which of the other connected nodes they want to communicate with. They include broadcast and multicast addresses in addition to unicast.


12. What is routing?
Routing is the process of systematically determining how to forward messages toward the destination node based on its address, when the sending and receiving nodes are not directly connected.


13. What is multiplexing?
Multiple hosts share a link at the same time, like a processor.


14. Describe types of multiplexing.
-synchronous time-division multiplexing: round-robin equally-sized quanta.
-frequency-division multiplexing: each signal gets unique frequency, like TV channels.


15. What is statistical multiplexing, and why is it important?
-It is what makes packet-switched networks efficient.
-Like STDM, but transmits on-demand to avoid wasted time slots. It uses defined upper bound on size of transmission to ensure rotation of flows (packet size).
-Defines a cost-effective way for users to share network resources in a fine-grained manner.
-Packet is granularity with which links are allocated to flows, each switch able to schedule the use of links on a per-packet basis.


16. What are the key challenges of statistical multiplexing?
Fairly allocating link capacity to different flows and dealing with congestion.


17. What decision does the transmitting switch have in statistical multiplexing?
-FIFO: simply transmit in order.
-round robin: alternate transmissions among flows.
-quality of service: ensure certain flows have minimum allocated bandwidth.


18. What is congestion?
Transmitting switch buffers multiplexed packets to fit link it sends over. When buffer fills up, packets are dropped.  


19. What are channels?
Channels are logical pipes connecting applications, offering various services such as reliability, order maintenance, and security. Logical Application to application channels are layered on top of physical host to host channels. There are different types to suit needs of both applications and provide modularity.


20. How do client and server work for reading and writing?
-writing: client sends data to server, server acknowledges.
-reading: client sends small request message and server responds with data.


21. Describe request/reply versus message stream channels.
-Request/reply: guarantees one copy received, privacy
-message stream: no delivery guarantee needed, but order guarantee. Privacy, multicast. efficient.


22. What are design tradeoffs with channels?
-New channel types must be created to suit new applications instead of maintaining simplicity of few types.
-channel services can be implemented in network switches or in applications at ends of channel.


23. What are the three classes of failures?
-bit errors: flipped 0 or 1, occur in bursts, quite rare 1 in 10^6 to 10^14. Correctable by flipping, if known which bits, else packet dropped.
-packet failures: usually congestion, difficult to know lost or slow packet.
-node and link failures: rare but long down time


24. What is the semantic gap?
Defining useful channels involves both understanding applications’ requirements and recognizing limitations of underlying technology. Semantic gap is challenge of fulfilling requirements with available technology.


1.3 architectures + 1.4 software


25. What are network architectures and what are the most well known?
Blueprints to guide and design the implementation of networks, addressing complexity through abstraction, namely layering which provides modularization. They may follow policies established by standardization bodies like IETF and ISO. Most well known are OSI and Internet architectures.


26. What is a protocol?
Abstract objects that make up layers of a network system. A protocol stack is a vertical combination of protocols. E.g. RRP: request-reply protocol, HHP: Hybrid Hypertext Processor, MSP: Microsoft Point-to-Point.


27. What are the two interfaces defined by a protocol?
-service interface: defines operations that local objects can use to communicate with the protocol, eg fetch operation of HTTP protocol.
-peer interface: defines format of messages to and from another machine, eg GET command format in HTTP protocol defines arguments and response of GET function.




  
  



28. What is encapsulation?
Message payloads are hidden from peer-to-peer protocols, which only process headers pertaining to lower layers. The peer-to-peer message is processed in reverse by the receiving protocol, removing the lower-level headers in-order and passing the exact body that was sent to a higher layer.
  



29. Protocols can act similarly to switches, multiplexing and demultiplexing messages from multiple higher-level protocols, e.g. multiple applications sharing one RRP, using a demux key in the header to identify the destination application.


30. Describe the OSI model.
7-layer reference model for protocol graph, no longer used but referenced.
-On all nodes, including switches:
1.physical layer: handles transmission of raw bits over a communications link.
2.data link: collects stream of bits into a larger aggregate called a frame, delivered to host.
3.network layer: handles routing among nodes within a packet-switched network. Called packets instead of frames, but same thing.
-Only on end nodes:
        4.transport: process-to-process channel, “messages” instead of packets.


        5.session: provides name space for multiple streams in single application, does things like combine audio and video in teleconferencing.
6.presentation: host-to-host data formatting, eg integer size, endianness, video stream format 
        7.application layer: includes protocols such as HTTP


31. Describe the Internet (TCP/IP) Architecture.
2.subnetwork: wide variety of network protocols, ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi 
3.Internet Protocol (IP): single protocol, supports the interconnection of multiple networking technologies into a single, logical internetwork.
4.Transmission control protocol / User datagram protocol: reliable byte-stream channel or unreliable datagram delivery channel for application programs. end-to-end/transport protocols.
7.application protocols: HTTP, FTP, Telnet, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, enable interoperation of applications. 


32. What is important to note / benefits of the Internet Architecture?
-It has an hourglass design (IP focal point), representing minimal and carefully-chosen set of capabilities, that allows both higher-level applications and lower-level communication technologies to coexist, share capabilities, and evolve rapidly. 
-Non-strict layering, very flexible.
-IETF culture must approve new protocols.


33. What are APIs and what is the socket interface?
-APIs are syntax by which protocols’ services can be invoked on a particular computer system.
-API defining the demarcation point between applications running on top of the Internet, and the details of how the Internet is implemented, a socket being where an application attaches to the internet. 
-Linux and C
-Well-defined and stable, leading to Internet application explosion into multi-billion dollar industry. 


34. What are addresses and ports?
-An address is a data structure that includes both IP address and TCP port of a server.
-ports: used to indirectly identify processes, a form of demux key. Usually some well-known service-specific number, such as 80 for servers to accept connections.


35. How do server and client establish socket connection?
-server: socket, bind, listen, accept, (send/recv)
-client: socket, connect, (send/recv)


36. What are passive and active open of a socket?
Note a server (after listening to find number of pending connections) creates a second socket during connect through a blocking operation that returns a new socket and the remote participant’s address. The server’s original socket remains, in passive open state, for future accept calls.
In an active open, the client says who it wants to communicate with using connect, returning the server’s address.




1.5 Performance


37. What is bandwidth?
Bandwidth (throughput) is the number of bits over time (bps), or how long it takes to transmit each bit.


38. How much time to transmit each bit for a 10Mbps network?
10,000,000 bps = 1s / 10,000,000 bits 
1s / 10,000,000 bits x (1/10,000,000s) / (1/ 10,000,000 bits) = 1x10^-7s / bit = 0.1 microseconds


39. What is the difference between bandwidth, datarate, and throughput?
Datarate and bandwidth refer to maximum rate supported by link. Throughput is the actual measured performance.


40. What are the widths of bits transmitted on 1- and 2-Mbps links (time per bit)?
1Mbps = 1s/1,000,000 bits = (1/1,000,000s) / 1 bit = 1 microseconds
2Mbps = 1s/2,000,000 bits = (1/2,000,000s) / 1 bit = 0.5 microseconds


41. What are latency and RTT?
Latency is how long it takes to travel from one end of a network to the other. 
Round trip time includes return time.


42. What are the three components of latency and its formula?
Speed of light propagation delay, data transmission time, queuing delays inside network.
Latency = propagation + transmit + queue
Propagation = distance / c
Transmit = packet size / bandwidth


43. * When to prioritize latency vs bandwidth?
Bandwidth doesn’t matter for very small data sizes, like 1 byte. Makes a difference for larger data sizes, whereas latency does not change.


44. How fast to transmit 25MB image with bandwidth of 10Mbps?
10,000,000 bits / s * t = 25,000,000 * 8 bits = 200,000,000 bits
t = 200,000,000 bits / 10,000,000 bits = 20s
!Doesn’t make sense: “It will take 20 seconds to transmit the image (25 × 106 × 8-bits / (10 × 106 Mbps = 20 seconds), making it relatively unimportant if the image is on the other side of a 1-ms channel or a 100-ms channel; the difference between a 20.001-second response time and a 20.1-second response time is negligible.” - p 39
Doesn’t channel scale transmit latency by factor of 10? 


45. Using delay x bandwidth product, how many bits can fit in a transcontinental channel with latency of 50ms and bandwidth of 45 Mbps?
50e-3 s x 45e6 bits/s = 2.25e6 bits
= 2.25 / 8 MB = 0.281MB


46. Why is the delay x bandwidth product important?
RTT x bandwidth is used in constructing high-performance networks to tell us how much data must be transmitted before receiving a response in order to fully utilize the network. An RTT is like a bus that increases in size when the bandwidth increases (but less RTTs are required).


47. How many round trips with 100ms RTT for a 1MB file for 1 Mbps and 1 Gbps (high speed) links?
Rtt * bandwidth * trips = data size
100ms * 1Mbps * N trips = 1MB
N trips = 8e6 bits / (1e-1s * 1e6 bits / s)
N trips = 8e6 bits / 1e5 bits
N trips = 80 trips


100ms * 1Gbps * N trips = 1MB
N trips = 8e6 bits / (1e-1s * 1e9 bits / s)
N trips = 8e6 bits / 1e8 bits
N trips = 8e-2 trips = 0.02 trips




48. What is important in a high speed link and why?
Latency dominates high-speed network design. Because more data can be transmitted per RTT (round trip time), each RTT becomes a significant amount of time. E.g. 100 -> 101 RTTs = 1% increase in trips (time). 1->2 RTTs = 100% increase in trips.


   


49. What is the effective throughput in fetching a 1MB file across a 1Gbps with 100ms RTT?
Throughput = size / time = 1MB / time
Time = RTT + size/bandwidth = 100ms + 1MB/1Gbps
= 1e-1s + 8e6 bits / 1e9 bits/s
= 1e-1s + 8e-3s = 0.1s + 0.008s
= 0.108s
Throughput = 8e6 bits / 0.108s
= 7.407e7 bps = 74.07 Mbps


50. Why does transferring a larger amount of data help improve the effective throughput?
Reduces the impact of overhead and latency on the total data transfer. Approaching an infinitely large transfer size causes throughput to approach network bandwidth. When transfer size is low relative to rtt x bandwidth, the sender must still wait one full RTT for a response, so volume in the ‘pipe’ is being wasted.


51. What is the struggle in placing an upper limit on an application’s bandwidth? What is the solution?
Video streams are compressed, transmitting only differences across frames, and frames themselves are also compressed. Therefore, video does not flow at a constant rate, and using the average does not account for fluctuations outside of the used time interval which exceed the maximum channel capacity. 
The solution is to buffer outgoing bursts which exceed the instantaneous capacity, so the stream is still steady with time, although this requires a delay.


52. What is jitter and its solution?
Jitter is variation in latency across packets often introduced by the network through multi-hop queuing delays. It implies the receiver of a video stream can handle early frames, but not late frames. 
The solution is to know the upper and lower bounds on latency that a packet can experience, basically estimating the largest inter-packet gap and delaying the entire stream by this amount using a buffer on the receiver’s end.


53. What are software defined networks and why relevant?
-Engineering practices applied to network internals rather than using applications on top, i.e. cloudification. 
-They are relevant because computer networks are in the midst of major innovation (feature velocity) while operators must also provide reliability. 
a.This is done using commodity hardware with software-based intelligence 
b.and devops, or agile engineering processes that break down barriers between development and operations.


Ch 2 direct links


Link-level protocols


2.1

667e3 m


56. What is modulation? 
Varying frequency, amplitude, or phase of a signal to “effect” the transmission of information.


57. How do copper wires carry multiple signals?


58. What is the implication of which frequency is used?




59. What are some link classifications and the technologies used?

Mobile/cellular: connectivity while moving, mobile wireless (4G, 5G)
Backbone: interconnect cities, point-to-point fiber links, synchronous optical network (SONET) technology
Local access network (LAN): carrier sense multiple access (Ethernet and WiFi)


2.2 Encoding
60. What is a network adaptor?
Piece of hardware connecting node to link, containing signalling component that en/decodes bits to signals. 


61. What are two problems in encoding?
-baseline wander: Average used to classify high/low signal weighted by too many consecutive repetitions of same signal
-clock recovery: transmitter and receiver signals require transitions for synchronization


62. What are types of encoding strategies?
Non-return to Zero, 
Non-return to Zero inverted, 
Manchester, 
4B/5B


2.3 Framing


63. What is the framing problem and 3 ways it’s addressed?
Recognizing what set of bits constitutes a frame.
1.byte-oriented protocols: point-to-point (PPP) uses sentinel approach: 
a.character stuffing, characters to delimit (DLE SYN) 
b.indicates number of frame’s bytes in header, bad if value is corrupted (framing error). Frame is transmitted in shown format, left-to-right.  
2.Bit-oriented protocols : high-level data link control (HDLC): bit stuffing, like character stuffing but 01111110 as delimiter.
3.clock-based framing: synchronous optical network (SONET): 
-complex, overhead bytes
-addresses framing problem and encoding problem
-can multiplex multiple low-speed links onto a high-speed link
-9 rows x 90 bytes = 810 byte-frames
-delimited by 2-byte bit pattern, but is not “stuffed” (escaped), meaning it is only differentiated by the same pattern in the body by determining frames are in sync.


2.4 error detection


64. Perform Internet Checksum Algorithm on the following integer sequence: -5, -3. Explain how checksum is used to detect an error and its pros/cons.


1010 + 1100 = 0110 //Note carry was cut off
0111 = -8 //one’s compliment: increment due to carry
Checksum = -8


-If the receiver’s calculation of checksum is different, either message or sent checksum were corrupted. 
-Uses small amount of redundant bits, but multiple errors can increment/decrement bits that cancel out, meaning the checksum will not detect the errors.


65. Perform Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Algorithm on the message:
Message: P(x) = 10011010
P(x) = x^7 + x^4 + x^3 + x^1
Divisor polynomial: C(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 1 = 1101 //k=3
//1.Multiply P(x) by x^3, since k=3. (append 3 0s)
10011010000
//2.Divide by C(x)
   
//3.Append remainder to polynomial, and send
10011010101
//4.Receiver divides this by C(x), and if 0, no error.




66. What are the tradeoffs between error detection and error correction?
-error detection: When errors occur, entire copy of message must be requested, then retransmitted, but fewer redundant bits per message.
-error correction requires a greater number of redundant bits (all the time) to send an error-correction code. More useful when 
1. errors are more probable, like in wireless, or 
2. cost of retransmission is too high, like due to latency of satellite link.


67. What is forward error correction? 
Just means redundant bits handle error correction in advance, rather than re-transmission with mere detection. Commonly used in 802.11 wireless network.


68. How is Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) implemented in hardware?
-Shift register with number of bits = k.
-XOR gate used to convert generator polynomial into binary.
-XOR also used to perform minus operation in polynomial arithmetic, because the operations are the same.


2.5 reliable transmission
Overhead of error correction codes is typically too large to handle to range of bit and burst errors, and always possible severely corrupted frames will be discarded. This section describes how a link-level protocol recovers from lost frames (although can be done in higher levels instead).


69. What are the two fundamental mechanisms of reliable transmission?
-acknowledgements: ACK small control frame sent back to peer signifying re-transmission not necessary. Can piggyback on other data frames.
-timeouts: Amount of time sender waits for ACK until retransmitting.


70. What are three algorithms of Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)?
Stop-and-wait, sliding window, and concurrent logical channels.


71. Explain stop-and-wait algorithm and its shortcoming.
Uses a timeout to wait for ACK from receiver to send next message. If not received in time, re-sends. Duplicate messages caused by ACK arriving after timeout are remedied using sequence bit in sent message’s header.
-shortcoming is it’s latency-bound, very slow, due to 1 message per RTT. 


72. In a 1.5-Mbps link with 45ms RTT, delay x bandwidth of 67.5Kb (8KB), and frame size of 1KB, what is the maximum sending rate?
Maximum sending rate = bits-per-frame / time-per-frame
= 8e3 b / 4.5e-2 s = 1.78e5 bps = 0.178 Mbps (178 Kbps)


0.178 Mbps / 1.5Mbps = 0.119 capacity used
//sanity check
Delay x bandwidth
.0045 x 0.178 = .000801
.0045 x 1.5 = 0.007
.000801 / .007 = .115 capacity used


73. Explain the sliding window algorithm
It allows subsequent frames to be sent before receiving ack for previous increasing capacity utilization. Using sequence numbers, the sender ensures the difference between the last acknowledgement received and the last frame sent does not exceed the send window size.


Receiver buffers frames until missing frames are received.
Window size can adapt to network conditions.


Straightforward approach doesn’t apply separation of concerns. 


74. What are the three roles of the sliding window algorithm?
1.reliably deliver frames across an unreliable link
2.preserve the order in which frames are transmitted
3.flow control: a feedback mechanism by which the receiver is able to throttle the sender


2.6 multi-access networks
75. What is Ethernet?
Wired LAN 
Uses carrier sense, multiple access with collision detect (CSMA/CD)
CSMA/CD ensures devices take turns transmitting to avoid collisions, but isolated paths are now commonly used
Competes with 802.11 (WiFi)


Ethernet Receiver
76. What is Media access control (MAC)?
Algorithm that controls access to a shared Ethernet link. Implemented in hardware.
Every host in the worlds has a unique Ethernet address.
Each host on a network receives every frame but only accepts those addresses to its address, the broadcast address, a multicast address if it it assigned to listen to it, and if host is in promiscuous mode, all frames.


Ethernet transmitter
(This is for Shared networks with hubs; modern switched Ethernet networks have virtually eliminated collisions)
77. What is carrier sense?
Each Ethernet device is able to determine if the medium is busy, and waits until idle, else transmits immediately.
Collision is detected if medium signal is distorted while transmitting.
If collision, Stops transmitting and sends jam signal.
Waits for amount of time determined by exponential back off algorithm until retransmitting.


What is the worst case scenario?


78. What are the benefits of Ethernet?
- easy to administer and maintain
-Inexpensive




2.7 Wireless Networks


79. How do wireless links differ from wired?
-more bit errors due to unpredictable noise environment
-power: mobile devices have limited power, and excessive power causes interference
-inherently multi-access, MAC central issue and hard to prevent eavesdropping


80. How is medium shared?
Dividing along frequency and space; frequencies allocated to entities in particular areas, determined by FCC.


81. What is spread spectrum and what are two techniques?
Spreading signal over wider frequency band to minimize impact of interference from other devices. 
-Frequency hopping: implementing spread spectrum by algorithmically changing frequencies of transmitter and receiver in parallel.
-Direct sequence: The original data signal (narrowband) is multiplied by a spreading code (a pseudorandom sequence of bits, also called a chip sequence).
This spreading code runs at a much higher rate (chip rate) than the original data signal, spreading the signal energy across a wider frequency band.


82. What are basic topologies for wireless networks?
-base station model: client nodes go through base station
-mesh/ad hoc: no base station, nodes are peers and can forward messages through others.


83. What are techniques to increase data rate of IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)?
-originally 2Mbps
-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM): divides a high-speed data stream into multiple lower-speed sub-streams, which are then transmitted simultaneously over multiple orthogonal sub-carriers. This approach improves data transmission efficiency and robustness in environments prone to interference and multipath fading.
-multiple input, multiple output (MIMO): a wireless communication technology that uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance. It enhances the capacity, speed, and reliability of wireless systems by exploiting spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing




84. What is the benefit of lower bit rate?
-Easier to decode signals in presence of noise (achieved using different modulation scheme)
-More redundant information means more resilience to bit errors (bit rate inherently lowered by transmitting redundant bits)


85. How is the best bit rate chosen?
Estimate bit error rate (BER) using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at physical layer.


86. What are problems in collision avoidance for wireless networks?
-hidden node problem:  
 
-exposed node problem:  
C can interfere with B’s reception of A, but cannot detect A’s interference.






87. What is carrier sense multiple access / collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)?
 Uses RTS-CTS (Ready to Send-Clear to Send) packets,, containing a time limit until other transmitters must wait until transmitting.
1.Transmitter sends RTS telling receiver to send CTS packet
2.CTS packet contains time limit until other transmitters can send
3.transmitter successfully receives CTS packet, sends actual packet
4.Failed CTS reception triggers exponential backoff retries for RTS.


88. What is a distribution system?
How access points (non-mobile nodes in base-station-oriented topologies) are interconnected.
A node performs active scanning, an algorithm where it probes access points to determine which to connect to.
Access points perform passive scanning, sending beacons advertising transmission capabilities.
  



2.7.3 Bluetooth (802.15.1)


89. Describe bluetooth.
-~3Mbps, 10m range Personal access network (PAN).
-piconet configuration: master and up to 7 slaves. Only master-slave communication.
-license-exempt band, requires frequency hopping spread spectrum to deal with interference.
-ZigBee similar to Bluetooth, for sensor networks.


2.8 Access Networks


90. What are the 2 types of access networks?
-passive optical networks (PON): fiber to home
-cellular network


91. What is a central office?
Edge site where ISP’s (telco or cable company) national backbone connects to city, edges of ISP network.
  
  

92. What are splitters and repeaters?
They forward frames without storing them; splitters in PON, repeaters in Ethernet.


93. Where does framing happen in PONs?
Optical line terminal (OLT) in ISP premises
Optical network unit (ONU) in home endpoint


94. How does PON’s sharing algorithm work?
Downstream: broadcast: all OLTs receive all packets transmitted by ONU.
Upstream: TDMA: OLTs implement round robin to grant ONUs slices of transmit time.


95. How does LTE (3G-6G) work differently from WiFi?
Allocation of radio spectrum to UEs is reservation-based, not contention-based (which is like Ethernet as well). It expects high usage and explicitly assigns shares to users.


96. What is orthogonal frequency-division multiple access?
Data can be simultaneously send by multiple users through 12 subcarrier frequencies, using coding to minimize interference.


97. What is a resource element?
Minimum schedulable unit, 15-kHz wide band around one subcarrier frequency and the time it takes to transmit one OFDMA symbol.
  

98. How many bits can be encoded per symbol for each modulation rate?
Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM): 
16-QAM: 4
64-QAM: 6

99. What is the internetworking problem?
Ethernet is limited to 1024 hosts, point-to-point limited to 2, wireless limited by radio range.
1.How interconnect links? Bridges (L2 switch): to connect ethernet segments.
2.How deal with heterogeneity (connect different types of networks)? gateways/routers (L3 switch): Use IP protocol.
3.Routing: Finding efficient loop-free, and dynamic routes.


3.1 Switching Basics


100. What is a star topology?
Allows multiple hosts to connect to a switch without reducing performance of other connected hosts, like with shared-media network (all hosts are directly connected to switch, instead of to medium).


101. What is reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM)?
Node in layer-2 optical transport network performing dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM), where single fiber transmits >100 wavelengths, each with >100Gbps of data. Obstures a single wavelength as a single point-to-point link between to switches that are connected to either end. Reconfigurable, meaning end-to-end (packet-switched network constructed on top) wavelengths and topologies can be changed.


102. What is forwarding and what are the 3 methods?
Aka switching, forwarding of packets from one link to another by a switch. Each packet has a destination host address, each ethernet card has globally unique identifier, each switch has input and output ports.
1. Datagram Switching
* Definition: A packet-switched network approach where each packet is treated as an independent unit of data.
* How it Works:
   * Each packet (datagram) contains destination information (like an address).
   * Packets are routed independently of each other, which means they may take different paths through the network.
   * Packets may arrive at their destination out of order and require reassembly.
* Key Characteristics:
   * No dedicated path: The network does not establish a fixed path between the sender and receiver.
   * Dynamic routing: Routers decide the best route for each packet at the moment it is transmitted.
   * Unreliable delivery: Packets might be delayed, dropped, or arrive out of order.
   * Example Protocols: IP (Internet Protocol), which is the foundation of the internet, uses datagram switching.
* Analogy: Sending individual postcards through the postal system, where each postcard might take a different route to the destination.
________________


2. Virtual Circuit Switching
* Definition: A packet-switched network approach where a logical path (or virtual circuit) is established between the sender and receiver before sending data packets.
* How it Works:
   * A virtual circuit is created between the sender and receiver, often using a setup message.
   * Once established, all packets follow the same predefined route (like in circuit switching).
   * The circuit remains active until the communication ends, after which it is terminated.
* Key Characteristics:
   * Fixed path: All packets take the same route through the network.
   * Orderly delivery: Packets arrive in the correct order since they follow the same path.
   * Setup phase: Requires an initial setup phase to establish the virtual circuit.
   * Reliable delivery: Virtual circuits offer more reliability, as resources like bandwidth can be reserved.
   * Example Protocols:
      * TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) over IP provides reliability by simulating virtual circuits.
      * Legacy protocols like X.25 and ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) use virtual circuit switching.
* Analogy: Like making a phone call where a path is set up before communication begins, and all messages take the same path.
3.Source routing is a routing technique in computer networks where the sender (source) specifies the entire route (or a partial route) that the packet should take to its destination. Instead of leaving the routing decisions entirely to intermediate routers, the sender embeds the routing path within the packet itself.




3.2 Switched Ethernet


103. How can multiple ethernets be connected?
In networking, a bridge is a device that connects and filters traffic between two or more network segments, usually within the same local area network (LAN). It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions. Bridges help improve network performance, reduce congestion, and divide large networks into smaller, manageable segments.


104. What is the learning bridge algorithm?
Primitive method for a switch to fill in its forwarding table, assigning each received frame’s source address (host) to the port it came through.


105. What is the Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA)?
Removes loops from a network, ensuring each switch is aware of the same spanning tree.
When there are multiple bridges in a network, redundant links might form loops. This can cause:
Broadcast storms: Broadcast packets (like ARP requests) keep circulating endlessly.
MAC table instability: Bridges continuously learn and relearn incorrect paths due to packets looping.
Network congestion: Loops cause duplicated frames, overwhelming the network.
What the Spanning Tree Algorithm Does
The Spanning Tree Algorithm ensures that there is only one active path between any two devices in the network. It disables redundant links, creating a loop-free tree structure while retaining redundancy for failover purposes.
Root Bridge: The central bridge in the spanning tree with the lowest Bridge ID.
Root Port: The port on a non-root bridge with the shortest path to the Root Bridge.
Designated Port: The port that provides the best path to the Root Bridge for a specific segment.
Blocked Port: A port that is not part of the spanning tree to avoid loops.
Example Network:
* 3 bridges: B1, B2, B3
* Interconnected via multiple links.
Step 1: Root Bridge Election
* Suppose:
   * B1 has Bridge ID = 1
   * B2 has Bridge ID = 2
   * B3 has Bridge ID = 3
* B1 becomes the Root Bridge because it has the lowest Bridge ID.
Step 2: Root Port Selection
* Each bridge identifies the port with the shortest path to B1 (Root Bridge).
* If B2 is connected to B1 via a 100 Mbps link and B3 via a 1 Gbps link:
   * B2's root port points to B1 via the 100 Mbps link.
   * B3's root port points to B1 via the 1 Gbps link.
Step 3: Designated Ports
* On each network segment, the bridge with the shortest path to the Root Bridge assigns its port as the Designated Port for that segment.
Step 4: Block Redundant Ports
* If multiple links connect two bridges, only one port remains active while others are blocked to prevent loops.


Convergence Time: Traditional STP (IEEE 802.1D) can take tens of seconds to reconverge after a topology change, which may not be suitable for time-sensitive applications.
Inefficiency: Redundant links are disabled, which can waste bandwidth.
Complexity in Large Networks: Managing spanning trees in large-scale networks can become complex.




106. What is a virtual LAN (VLAN)?
Solves scalability problem of limiting broadcast to partition of a network. Allows change to logical topology without moving wires or changing addresses. Uses VLAN header to only forward packets within same VLAN.


3.3 Internet (IP)


107. What is an internetwork?
-Collection of multiple interconnected networks that communicate with each other. These networks can be of different types (e.g., local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or metropolitan area networks (MANs)) and are connected through networking devices such as routers, gateways, or switches.
-Using layer 3 technologies, they improve upon bridged networks in scalability, heterogeneity, and routing efficiency.


108. Why pick L2 versus L3 networks?
L2: network is a single broadcast domain.
L3: want hosts to be on different networks. Offer solutions to scaling and heterogeneity limitations.


  



109. What is IP?
-”The key tool used today to build scalable, heterogeneous internetworks.”
-IP (Internet Protocol) is the fundamental protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite that provides unique addressing and routing for data communication over a network. It operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and enables data packets to travel from a source device to a destination device across interconnected networks.
Key Features of IP
Packet-Switched: IP breaks data into small units called packets, which are sent independently across the network.
Connectionless: IP does not establish a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver before sending data.
Best-Effort Delivery: IP does not guarantee delivery, error correction, or in-order arrival of packets. It relies on higher-layer protocols (like TCP) for reliability.
Global Addressing: Every device on an IP-based network has a unique identifier, the IP address.






110. What is hierarchical aggregation?
IP addresses are split into network and host addresses. This improves scalability of large networks by requiring routers only to deal with network addresses. 
  



111. What is the difference between forwarding and routing?
Forwarding is the process of taking a packet from and input and sending it to the appropriate output.
Routing is the process of building up the tables that allow the correct output for a packet to be determined.


112. What is a private IP address, versus a public IP address?
Private IP addresses are assigned to hosts in a private network, for the gateway to use to address packets from the internet. They are not addressable from the public internet, securing private hosts, and are often reused across private networks, which conserves scarce public IPs. They often consist of 192.168.x.x. They allow the network’s gateway to take advantage of the hierarchical IP structure when routing packets. They are necessary for hosts to send packets to other networks, because the host is responsible for creating layer 3 packets. This is why a router can’t simply use each host’s layer 2 MAC address instead.


113. What really is subnetting?
Subnetting is simply granularization of classful IP addressing, which only allowed network sizes of 254, ~65,000, or ~16.7m hosts per class C, B, or A network. Only 16,000 class B were available, and using many class A networks for a single institution clearly wasn’t feasible. Subnetting allows you to segment your network into a custom assortment of sub-networks, importantly adding on subnetworks as needed (scalability).


114. What are benefits of subnetting?
1.Efficient use of scarce network addresses
2.Improves router efficiency by reducing forwarding table sizes.
3.Broadcast message traffic reduced, only going to intended subnetwork.
4.Increased security, segmenting communication between departments.


115. What 4 assumptions can be made about network forwarding?
1.Every datagram contains destination IP address
2.The network part of an IP address uniquely identifies a physical network that is part of the Internet
3.All hosts and routers that share the same network part of their address are connected to the same physical network, and can communicate with frames
4.Every physical network connected to the Internet has a router that can communicate with other networks and the network itself.


116. How is a datagram sent by a host, depending on the destination address?
If it’s on the same physical network, it can be sent directly. Otherwise it is sent to the next hop router (the one it deems the best) or else the assigned default router.


117. A datagram’s destination address is 128.96.34.15 and its subnet’s subnet mask is 255.255.255.128. Where does the host send the datagram?
1.calculate address
Bitwise and of 28.96.34.15 and 255.255.255.128 = 
128.96.34.0.
2.forward if same subnet, else send to next hop router.
3.Router performs step 1 for dest. address and each entry’s subnet mask, comparing to each entry’s subnet address. If equals, sends to corresponding next hop.


118. What is supernetting, or Classless interdomain routing (CIDR)?
Supernetting is typically used by ISPs or large organizations to combine, rather than split, networks. It is basically adding a router to aggregate many contiguous network addresses into a single address. The purpose is to simplify routing and reduce the size of routing tables. As an example, if a company needed dozens of 256-host networks, that would require dozens of different addresses in a router’s routing table, and supernetting allows a single router to handle that.
CIDR notation for subnet masks of arbitrary length e.g. /27, /30


119. Apply longest match rule to the following table addresses:
a)171.69
b)171.69.10
What does destination address 171.69.10.5 match?
b)
What does destination address 171.69.20.5 match?
a)


120. What is address resolution protocol (ARP)?
System of building up a table of mappings of IP addresses to link-level addresses in each node of a network. It is basically a cache, storing responses to ARP requests. An ARP request is a request for a single MAC address corresponding to a received datagram destination address, broadcast to all hosts on the network when a host receives a datagram. 


121. What is dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)?
System of automatically assigning IP addresses to hosts on a network. Improves manageability of a network by requiring a range of addresses to be configured to a DHCP server rather than individual addresses to each host.




122. What is a public, versus a private network?
A public network has at least one host with a public IP, addressable by the public internet, such as a server. A private network, although having a public IP for its gateway router, assigns only private IPs to each host, such as in home and corporate networks.


123. What is network address translation (NAT)?
-Basically, conversion between a private IP and a pair consisting of public IP and port.
-It makes it so that traffic from the public internet cannot go to private hosts unless a request is first sent by a private host.
-During outbound transmission from a private network, a router changes the source IP of the packet from the private IP to the router’s own public IP. The router now uses a dynamically assigned port number in the packet header to correspond with the former private IP, storing this mapping in the NAT table. When a response is received from the public internet, the same port is in the header, so the router can swap the destination address back to the source private IP corresponding to the port.




124. What is port forwarding?
It is a way of allowing inbound requests to a private host (specifically, a particular service or application). Normally with NAT, only the private network’s router is concerned with a private host’s source port, and public traffic does not know how to address a private host. Port forwarding provides a public port, mapped to a private host’s service’s private port, so that public traffic can send packets to it, effectively reversing NAT. The router then forwards the inbound packet to the private IP and port mapped to the provided public port.


125. What is IP tunneling?
Purpose: IP tunneling, like port forwarding, allows inbound traffic, but to an entire network instead of a single service. It effectively creates a single network, but connected over shared physical connections, such as the public internet.
How works: A transmitting host is able to use private IPs from another network, and the reason the connecting routers can process the private IP is that the packet is encapsulated in another IP packet with the routers being the source and destination. Only after the receiving router decapsulates the packet does it route it using the private destination IP. 




126. What is a virtual private network (VPN)?
It is basically a set of IP tunneled networks using encryption.
Security: The inner packet header and payload are encrypted, which prevents the private IP and port from being read by intermediate hosts in the internet, with which an attacker could DDOS or brute force a private host.








3.4 Routing


127. What are the two major classes of graph-based distributed routing algorithms?
1.distance-vector routing or routing information protocol (RIP)
-Bellman Ford, minimizing number of hops
2.Link-state routing or open shortest path first (OSPF)
-Dijkstra’s algorithm, can optimize bandwidth, delay, cost, or a combination.


128. What is reliable flooding?
Advertisement of link-state information to all other nodes in routing protocol.


3.5 Implementation
  

129. What are the two types of processing done in a router?
1.Control plane: background processing required to control the network (OSPF, RIP, BGP)
2.Data/user plane: per-packet processing required to move packets from input port to output port.


130. What is a network processor unit (NPU)?
Specialized processor in a white-box switch, optimized for parsing packet headers and making forwarding decisions, yielding performance measured in Tbps.


131. What is a software defined network (SDN)?
Designed to decouple control and data planes using a standard interface to enable running the control plane on commodity servers and data plane on white-box switches.


132. What is a network operating system (NOS)?


133. What is network virtualization?
Where VPNs only virtualize addressing and routing tables, a virtual network should support all basic abstractions of a physical network, as a virtual machine abstracts CPU, storage, and IO.

Ch. 4 Advanced Internetworking


134. What is an area?
Set of routers administratively configured to exchange link-state information.


135. What is an area border router (ABR)?
A router that is part of the backbone area and a non-backbone area.


136. What is OSPF?
A link-state routing protocol that partitions a routing domain into areas. Basically, networks in different areas communicate through ABRs, through the backbone. It hides link state information from other areas, using ABRs to advertise shortest path to destination networks. This provides scalability, although sometimes preventing optimality, as all inter-area paths must go through the backbone, even if they’re directly connected.


137. What are autonomous systems (AS)?
Internet routing domain.


138. What is border gateway protocol (BGP)?
Interdomain routing algorithm used by border routers and BGP speakers. Advertises complete paths as an enumerated list of ASs to reach a network. Prevents looping paths by detecting self in full path.
