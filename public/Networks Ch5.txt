174. How to turn this host-to-host packet delivery service into a process-to-process communication channel (Transport layer)? -UDP, 
-Reliable bytestream (TCP), 
-RPC
-transport protocols that use ports to indirectly specify a channel for sending and receiving between processes.


175. What does UDP do?
-Multiplexes to allow processes on a host to share network, using ports.
-checksum error detection.


176. What features toes TCP have?
-Guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of byte stream
-full-duplex
-flow control (limits sender)
-multiplexes like UDP
-congestion control


177. Explain the difference between flow and congestion control:
-flow control: end-to-end issue, prevents sender overloading receiver buffer
-congestion control: host-network issue, prevents excess injection into network overflowing switches/links


178. How does TCP sliding window differ from link-level?
1.logical connections over internet requiring establishment and teardown phases.
2.Retransmission timeout mechanism must be adaptive to variable latency.
3.Needs to handle receiving old packets 
4.Must learn buffer size of other side (flow control)


179. What are 3 purposes of TCP’s sliding window alg?
-1.guarantees reliable delivery
-2.ensures order of data
-3.flow control between sender and receiver


180. In TCP sliding window, how does sender know when AdvertisedWindow is no longer 0 if it’s not receiving acks, since it is blocked?
Sender sends Zero Window Probes every 5-60s to get an ack containing the AdvertisedWindow.


181. What is Karn/Partridge Alg?
-Don’t measure RTT from retransmissions. 
-Double timeout after each ret.


182. What is Jacobson/Karels?
More variance in RTT -> timeout more based on deviation than estimatedRTT


183. What is RPC?
Transport protocol with message identification, fragmentation/reassembly, reliability, marshalling.


Ch. 6
184. What are resource allocation, congestion control, and flow control?
-Congestion control is responding to overutilized buffers and bandwidth at any point in a network. 
-Resource allocation attempts to account for fairness.
-Flow control: congestion control between single sender-receiver.


185. How does congestion control differ from weighted-link routing?
Congestion control addresses bottleneck routers, congestion points that cannot be routed around.


186. What is a flow?
Sequence of packets sent between a source/destination pair following the same route through the network.


187. What is each router responsible for in a router-centric design?
1.Deciding when packets are forwarded
2.Deciding which packets are dropped
3.Informing hosts how many packets allowed to send


188. What is a host-centric design?
Hosts observe network conditions (# packets sent through) and adjust accordingly.


189. Explain reservation-based vs feedback-based system:
-reservation-based: Host requests each router to allocate buffers/bandwidth for flow.
-feedback-based: explicit (router messages) or implicit (dropped packets) feedback is used by host to adjust sending rate.


190. Explain window-based vs rate-based resource allocation:
-window-based: Receiver sends window advertisements for  reserve buffer space.
-rate-based: Sender reserves bps, routers determine if can support.


191. What are the 2 main service models?
-Best-effort: Host-Centric, Feedback, window-based
-QoS: Router-Centric, Reservation, Bandwidth/Rate-based


192. What are the 2 principle metrics of networking? How Related?
-Throughput and delay.
-Maximizing throughput requires larger queues, more delay.


193. How is “power” used?
Throughput / delay vs. load curve is optimized. At least, control load to prevent thrashing/congestion collapse, so system is “stable”.


194. Describe queueing disciplines:
-FIFO
-Priority queue: can starve lower priorities
-Fair queuing: round-robins packets by flow


195. Explain bit-by-bit round robin in fair queuing:
Because packets vary in size, lowest finishing time of the last packet in each queue is used to determine which is sent. Packets already being transmitted are not preempted.
196. What is the maximum segment size for TCP?
1 packet
197. What is additive increase / multiplicative decrease?
-Each timeout causes congestion window to halve until it is 1 MSS (1 packet).
-Each successful congestion window sent, it is increased by 1.


198. Why is it beneficial to aggressively reduce congestion window and gradually increase?
The consequences of having too large a congestion window are worse. With congestion, failed packets will trigger retransmission, making the problem worse.


199. What are the 2 scenarios where slow start is used?
1.beginning of connection
2.dropped packet causes blocked send buffer, cumulative ack basically restarts send window.
