183. What are resource allocation, congestion control, and flow control?
-Congestion control is responding to overutilized buffers and bandwidth at any point in a network. 
-Resource allocation attempts to account for fairness.
-Flow control: congestion control between single sender-receiver.


184. How does congestion control differ from weighted-link routing?
Congestion control addresses bottleneck routers, congestion points that cannot be routed around.


185. What is a flow?
Sequence of packets sent between a source/destination pair following the same route through the network.


186. What is each router responsible for in a router-centric design?
1.Deciding when packets are forwarded
2.Deciding which packets are dropped
3.Informing hosts how many packets allowed to send


187. What is a host-centric design?
Hosts observe network conditions (# packets sent through) and adjust accordingly.


188. Explain reservation-based vs feedback-based system:
-reservation-based: Host requests each router to allocate buffers/bandwidth for flow.
-feedback-based: explicit (router messages) or implicit (dropped packets) feedback is used by host to adjust sending rate.


189. Explain window-based vs rate-based resource allocation:
-window-based: Receiver sends window advertisements for  reserve buffer space.
-rate-based: Sender reserves bps, routers determine if can support.


190. What are the 2 main service models?
-Best-effort: Host-Centric, Feedback, window-based
-QoS: Router-Centric, Reservation, Bandwidth/Rate-based


191. What are the 2 principle metrics of networking? How Related?
-Throughput and delay.
-Maximizing throughput requires larger queues, more delay.


192. How is “power” used?
Throughput / delay vs. load curve is optimized. At least, control load to prevent thrashing/congestion collapse, so system is “stable”.


193. Describe queueing disciplines:
-FIFO
-Priority queue: can starve lower priorities
-Fair queuing: round-robins packets by flow


194. Explain bit-by-bit round robin in fair queuing:
Because packets vary in size, lowest finishing time of the last packet in each queue is used to determine which is sent. Packets already being transmitted are not preempted.
195. What is the maximum segment size for TCP?
1 packet
196. What is additive increase / multiplicative decrease?
-Each timeout causes congestion window to halve until it is 1 MSS (1 packet).
-Each successful congestion window sent, it is increased by 1.


197. Why is it beneficial to aggressively reduce congestion window and gradually increase?
The consequences of having too large a congestion window are worse. With congestion, failed packets will trigger retransmission, making the problem worse.


198. What are the 2 scenarios where slow start is used?
1.beginning of connection
2.dropped packet causes blocked send buffer, cumulative ack basically restarts send window.
