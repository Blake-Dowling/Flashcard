1. What is argument marshalling/serialization/encoding?
Convert base types, pack structures, and linearize complex structures to form a contiguous message.


2. What are 3 issues in argument marshalling?
1.How to make base types, flat types, and complex structures transmittable
2.Should receiver handle conversion (NxN/receiver-makes-right) or sending host (canonical intermediate form)?
3.determining types: tagged (data message has type augmentation) vs untagged (RPC function call specifies types) (arrays still need length tag)


3. What is a stub?
Code implementing argument marshalling, usually for RPC.
4. What is run length encoding?
-brute-force compression, replaces consecutive symbols/pixel values with count, symbol pair.
-Can increase size if not enough repetition in data.


5. What is differential pulse code modulation?
-Encodes symbols using difference from reference symbol (difference using less bits than symbols)
-Good when consecutive data has similar values


6. What is Lempel-Ziv?
-Store strings in dictionary and replace with index in the data.
